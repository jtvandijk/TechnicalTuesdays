## Technical Tuesdays

_Maintainers : Bala, Markus, and Justin_

This is repository for material concerning "Technical Tuesdays" Seminar, organised in Pearson G.02 at 17:00 every Tuesday. 
Thank you all for who have joined us in the previous sessions; slides can be found below.

#### FAQ:

##### What can I expect when I attend a Technical Tuesday session?

The seminars are targeted at students and researchers with no, or only a little, background in scientific computing and data science. Our goal is to give a practical introduction to computing frameworks and tools including shell, R, Python, Javascript, databases, and version control. We aim to present these technologies in a simple and accessible way with general suggestions on how to choose between them. Every session starts with an introductory talk of about 40 minutes, presenting key features of the software or tool with some cool use cases (real-time or already completed). After the talk, there is time for a Q&A and informal discussion. 

##### When and where will the sessions take place?

The sessions will happen on Tuesday afternoons, 17h00-18h00, during Term 1. The first session is scheduled for October 15. All sessions will take place in Room G.02 in the Pearson Building, unless otherwise communicated.
